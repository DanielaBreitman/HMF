# HMF
Calculate the halo mass function (HMF)

## Running HMF

If you want to run the HMF test code, you just do:
>>> python main.py
Currently, it will only plot M * dn/dM vs M for a few z values.

To see how to run the HMF code, see inside main.py

main.py also includes a function to compare the runtime of this HMF module with halomod's hmf module.

## Running HAM

If you want to run the abundance matching code, you just do:
>>> python HAM.py
Currently, it will use the luminosity function results from Bouwens+14.
